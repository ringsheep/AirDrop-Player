# AirDrop Player

Ever wanted to play your music library file-by-file, without uploading it to cloud services? Now you can drop any folder or audio to you phone and listen it locally!<br>
This app is a free and simple combination of local files manager + a primitive music player, and of course, receiving files over the AirDrop.<br>

Lots of thanks to app icon authors<br>
